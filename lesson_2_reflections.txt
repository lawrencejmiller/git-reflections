1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a folder called .git and creates the repository. 

***
git add <filename> : Add to staging area
git reset <filename>: Removes from staging area but keeps in working directory.
***

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the holding area for file that are to be committed  on the 
next commit, while the working directory is the main location for all project 
files. The staging area allows the user to be selective about which changes are
part of any particular commit.

***
Specify a commit message on the command line: git commit -m "Commit message"
