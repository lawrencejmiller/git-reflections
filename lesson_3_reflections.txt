1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When I am working remotely; need access to my files via a mobile device; to 
security backup my files to the cloud since local storage alone is unreliable.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes introduced by automatically syncing may affect something I am currently 
working on.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

- Forks are clones that are created solely on GitHub and link back to the original
creator of the repo.

- Clones are copies of any repo (remote or local) that reside on the users local 
machine. Done using the git clone command.

- Branches are separate paths along the git log where changes are made, but the	
commits are following along the label provided to the branch. They are 
tangential breaks from commit histories where new paths are created for various
reasons.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

You have access to the latest oublished version of the code available for any 
current work you are doing.
