1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When I am working remotely; need access to my files via a mobile device; to 
security backup my files to the cloud since local storage alone is unreliable.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes introduced by automatically syncing may affect something I am currently 
working on.
